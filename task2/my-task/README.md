# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Hereâ€™s a `README.md` for **Task 2** (`Amrutam Pharmaceuticals Assignment\task2\my-task`) based on your project setup:

### **README for Task 2**

**Title:** Design Conversion - Task 2

---

 **Project Overview**  
This project is part of the Amrutam Pharmaceuticals ReactJS Development internship assignment. It involves converting the second given Figma design into a React.js webpage while adhering closely to the original design specifications. The task focuses on implementing the design efficiently using React.js and optimizing the user experience.

---

**Technologies Used**  
- React.js  
- TypeScript (Optional, depending on your implementation)  
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)  
- Framer Motion (for animations)  

---

**Features**  
- **Pixel-perfect design**: Converted from Figma design, ensuring accuracy.
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal display.
- **User-friendly UI**: Includes smooth transitions and motion effects for enhanced user experience.

#### **Setup Instructions**  
1. **Navigate to the App Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Amrutam Pharmaceuticals Assignment/task2/my-task
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   First, install all the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   Run the following command to start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the App**:
