 **Amrutam Pharmaceuticals Assignment**

This repository contains the solutions for the internship assignment provided by Zarity Health. It includes two tasks based on Figma design conversions into React.js applications.

---

**Task 1: Design Conversion - Task 1**

**Project Overview**  
In this task, the objective was to convert the first given Figma design into a React.js TypeScript webpage. The goal was to adhere closely to the original design while enhancing the user experience through animations and motion design.

---

**Technologies Used**  
- React.js  
- TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)  
- Framer Motion (for animations)  

---

**Features**  
- **Pixel-perfect design**: The app follows the Figma design closely, maintaining consistency.
- **Responsive design**: The layout is optimized for different screen sizes.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and motion effects are added to enhance user interaction.

**Setup Instructions**  
1. **Navigate to the App Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Amrutam Pharmaceuticals Assignment/Task1/my-test_app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   Start the app using:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the App**:
   Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/
   ```





**Task 2: Design Conversion - Task 2**

**Project Overview**  
For this task, the objective was to convert the second given Figma design into a React.js webpage. This task focuses on implementing the design using React.js, ensuring that the user experience is smooth and responsive.

---

**Technologies Used**  
- React.js  
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)  
- Framer Motion (for animations, if implemented)

---

**Features**  
- **Pixel-perfect design**: The app closely follows the Figma layout.
- **Responsive design**: The app is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth transitions**: Animations are used to enhance the overall user experience.
